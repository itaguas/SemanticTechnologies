Proteins are so complex that it is really difficult to make a clear classification. Thus, there is not one clear way to classify proteins, and the main protein sources often have very different ways of doing it. UniProt, for instance, classifies proteins according to the family they belong to (a protein family is a group of evolutionarily related proteins). Protein Ontology, on the other side, has defined a great number of functions, and classifies proteins according to which of those is its function. Other protein-related sites have many different classification methods.
We believe that the easiest way to classify proteins is by their function; however, the classification used in Protein Ontology is way too complex, since the functions that define the groups are very concrete; therefore, it may be quite difficult to understand for people that are not specifically working on protein-related topics. We have developed an ontology with wider groups, so that a more straightforward classification is available for users without much knowledge in proteins. At the same time, we want our ontology to also be useful to obtain more protein in-depth knowledge, so each protein instance has very specific data regarding its sequence, the gene that encodes it, its function at the most detailed levelâ€¦
