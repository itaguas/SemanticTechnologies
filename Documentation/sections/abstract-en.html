<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The purpose of MCBPO is to provide a simple classification model for proteins according to their function, while containing at the same time very specific data of each protein introduced. For this purpose, MCBPO has the following characteristics: (1) proteins are divided in seven disjoint sets according to their function, and (2)for each protein, the ontology contains information (if available)for its cellular location, the species it belongs to, in which biological processes it is involved and by which gene it is encoded. MCBPO als ocontains information such as the protein ID and name, sequence and sequence length, and accession number.
